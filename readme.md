GitHub Issues Viewer
=============

[http://github-issues-demo.herokuapp.com/](http://github-issues-demo.herokuapp.com/)

An example Backbone application that connects to the GitHub Issues REST API and displays
issues from the `rails/rails` project.

You can run this locally through Sinatra, or just check out the live version and compare it with the source code here.
